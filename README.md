# auto_synctube_playlist

dependent on shuffleTextFile to work or else it wont shuffle the file after use and won't run at all

Afaik still bug with sometimes shuffle causing there to be two links on the same line, dont know if it breaks the program or not but still annoying

needs to be altered to work with file path of the link text file
