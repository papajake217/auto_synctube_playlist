dependent on shuffleTextFile to work or else it wont shuffle the file after use and won't run at all

As far as I know, there is still bug with sometimes shuffle causing there to be two links on the same line, don't know if it breaks the program.

needs to be altered to work with file path of the link text file. Links.txt can be changed too, there is just sample links there for now.
